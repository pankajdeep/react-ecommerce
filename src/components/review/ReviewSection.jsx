            I have a pair of Bose wired QC-35 so this is my base for comparison.
            I bought these because I was tired of having the cable in my way all
            the time. Context: I use the XM-4 mostly with my laptop but they're
            also paired with my Galaxy S10. The only noises I have in my
            environment are my wife sitting about a meter away from me in our
            home office and she speaks very loudly when she is in a virtual
            meeting (and she has quite a lot of them and the keyboard clicks.
            So, noise cancelling is mostly used for surrounding voice. Let's
            start with noise cancelling: The Sony XM4 have about the same noise
            cancellation quality as the wired QC-35 but the XM4 have a white
            noise that is a bit bugging me when I'm not listening to anything,
            just using them for noise cancellation while the QC-35 do not have a
            white noise and can cancel noise as well as the XM4. I mostly use
            noise cancellation because my wife is sitting about one meter away
            and she very often takes phone meeting and she speaks quite loudly.
            The XM4 and the QC-35 cancel about 60% of her voice so when I listen
            to music, even at low volume I don't hear her at all. Sound: The
            sound is a bit better than the wired QC-35. The bass is deep and all
            the frequencies are crisp and clear.
            <br />
            <br />I can hear every single instruments very clearly so I can
            enjoy my music better than ever before. These headphones should
            definitely be able to satisfy the most demanding audiophiles out
            there. Also they can play loud enough to damage your ear drums which
            is pretty good for wireless headphones. The sound is as good whether
            it comes from my laptop or my Galaxy S10 phone. Calls using my
            Galaxy S10: If I receive a call on my Galaxy S10 while listening to
            music on my laptop (or my phone), the XM4 will pause the music and
            ring in the headphones. A simple double tap on the touch sensor and
            I can answer the call or reject it by holding a finger on the touch
            sensor. The quality of the audio during calls is excellent; I can
            hear very well and I'm told that the sound on the other side of the
            conversation is very good. I never tried them in a noisy environment
            or outside when the wind is blowing but Sony states that the XM4
            will cancel most of the ambiant noise to keep the other side of the
            call clean. Features: I love the many features the XM4 offer. Here
            are a few features I particularly like: 1. When listening to music,
            I just have to take the headphones off and the XM4 will
            automatically pause the music thanks to the proximity sensor inside
            the left can. I simply have to put them back on for the music to
            start again. 2. When I listen to music and I want to talk to
            someone, I don't have to take them off, I just have to start talking
            and the music will automatically pause and the mics on the unit will
            make sure I can hear what's being said so I can carry a conversation
            without taking them off. Then, 15 or 30 seconds (configurable) after
            I stop talking, the music starts again. 3. Finally, the multiple
            commands I can use on the touch sensor such as volume up/down,
            next/previous song, fast-forward/backward and more. Another feature
            that is nice for those who want to use it is the integration with
            Alexa or Google assistant. However since I do not use any assistant,
            I cannot comment on this. Comfort: I have regular size ears so the
            cups surround them completely and do not put pressure on any part of
            my ears. I was able to wear them for 9 hours straight (while wearing
            glasses) with one short break in the middle for lunch and I felt no
            discomfort. Comparatively, the QC-35 have about the same size cup
            but the leather on the QC-35 is more comfortable than on the XM4.
            App: The Sony "Headphone" app is pretty good and complete, helping
            you customize your headphone sound and behavior very easily. You can
            configure an equalizer to adjust the sound to your specific
            preferences, customize the function of the second button on the left
            ear piece, turn on/off different feature of the XM4, update the
            firmware, and more. If your willing to give the app GPS location
            permission, you can have different configuration depending on where
            you are, home, office, commute, etc. This is a big one for me, I'm
            not forced to give GPS location permission to the app, contrary to
            the Bose Bluetooth headphone app. With Bose, if you don't give GPS
            location permission, you can't even pair your headphones! I won't
            comment on the location feature of the XM4 since I'm not using it
            but I'm happy I'm not forced to give this permission. Cons: I had to
            think hard to find any cons but here they are. 1. I cannot use the
            headphones while charging but this is minor since the battery life
            is so long and you can use them with the supplied 3.5mm cord but
            without the mic function. 2. The cushions on the QC-35 are more
            comfortable, softer than the ones on the XM4. I've read a lot of
            reviews mentioning problems with TV sound so I tested my MX4 with my
            Samsung Smart TV; the pairing was easy enough but the sound was
            constantly choppy so I would not recommend them if you want to watch
            TV with them. Summary: As far as I know, as of now these are the
            best wireless headphones on the planet! Great sound, feature rich
            and very comfortable but not recommended for TV watching.
